# PIOSI
THE SAGAS CONTINUE

## CORE Build

PIOSI CORE is a clean, data-driven version of the game designed to be wrapped with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and shipped, then expanded over time by updating content data files — no engine changes required.

### How CORE works

1. At startup the game reads `content/manifest.json` to discover which content packs and modes are enabled.
2. For each enabled pack it fetches `content/heroes.<pack>.json` and `content/levels.<pack>.json`.
3. If any fetch fails the game falls back to the static data in `heroes.js` / `levels.js` so you can still open the file directly without a server.

### Adding heroes

Open (or create) a hero pack JSON file such as `content/heroes.mypack.json`:

```json
{
  "heroes": [
    {
      "id": "paladin",
      "name": "Paladin",
      "symbol": "⛨",
      "sprite": "PIOSI Characters/Paladin.png",
      "attack": 5,
      "range": 1,
      "agility": 3,
      "hp": 22,
      "armor": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Then add `"mypack"` to the `packs` array in `content/manifest.json`:

```json
{ "packs": ["core", "mypack"] }
```

Add a matching `case "paladin":` entry in `modeup.js` to define Mode Up behaviour for the new hero.  Heroes without a case receive the default `ghis` fallback buff.

> **Tip:** Always set a stable lowercase `id` field. Mode Up logic (and future save/persistence systems) key off `hero.id` first, then fall back to `hero.name`.

### Adding levels

Open (or create) a level pack JSON file such as `content/levels.mypack.json`:

```json
{
  "levels": [
    {
      "level": 4,
      "title": "Level 4: The Outer Reach",
      "rows": 8,
      "cols": 10,
      "wallHP": 80,
      "enemies": [
        { "name": "Brigand", "symbol": "Җ", "attack": 3, "range": 1, "hp": 12, "agility": 2, "enemyXOffset": 3 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Enemies with `enemyXOffset` are placed at `cols - enemyXOffset` from the left edge (right side of the grid).  Enemies with explicit `x`/`y` coordinates are placed directly.

Add the pack to `content/manifest.json` and update `"coreLevels"` if you want the additional level to be reachable before the game transitions to victory.

### Enabling / disabling modes

Edit `content/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "packs": ["core"],
  "modes": {
    "battle":     true,
    "modeUp":     true,
    "worldMap":   false,
    "summit":     false,
    "emanations": false
  },
  "coreLevels": 3
}
```

| Mode         | Effect when `false`                                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `worldMap`   | World map screen is never shown; the world-map cheat code is also disabled. |
| `summit`     | Summit Mode is only accessible via the world map (already gated).           |
| `emanations` | Emanations Mode is only accessible via the world map (already gated).       |
| `modeUp`     | Reserved for future use; Mode Up still runs when `true`.                    |

Setting `worldMap: true` re-enables the world map and its entry points without any engine changes.

### Wrapping / shipping with Tauri

The CORE build is a self-contained HTML/JS application with no build step required.  To wrap it with Tauri:

1. `npm install --save-dev @tauri-apps/cli`
2. `npx tauri init` — point `distDir` at the repo root (or a dist folder if you run a bundler).
3. `npx tauri build` — produces a platform-specific installer.

The `content/` directory ships alongside the binary.  To add heroes or levels after release, replace or extend the JSON files and re-wrap — no Rust/engine recompilation needed.

## Design philosophy

PIOSI is built around a small set of convictions that should shape every decision:

**Fun before features.** A mechanic that isn't satisfying to execute — even once — doesn't belong in the game. Test the *feel* of every turn, not just the correctness. *(Miyamoto)*

**Zero barriers.** The game works by double-clicking `play.bat` (Windows) or `play.command` (macOS). No install, no build, no account. Every layer of friction between a new player and the first turn is a design failure. *(Gabe Newell)*

**Systems over scripts.** Heroes and enemies operate through stats, not named behaviors. A well-tuned stat system produces emergent encounters that no designer planned — and those are the memorable ones. *(Warren Spector, Peter Molyneux)*

**The world tells the story.** PIOSI has no cutscenes. Hero abilities, level layouts, enemy names, and Mode Up buffs are the narrative. Every data field is a storytelling decision. *(Ken Levine)*

**The interface should speak first.** If a new player needs the controls line at the bottom of the screen to understand what to do, the interface didn't do its job. Every screen should communicate its affordances visually before any text is read. *(Don Norman, Steve Krug)*
